# Dunhuang / In Motion

**An English-first, bilingual digital history exhibition about Dunhuang manuscripts, their circulation, knowledge networks and collections today.**

A project by **XIWEN WANG** ([GitHub profile](https://github.com/3380903218-cmd)).

Created for **HY5419 · Digital History, National University of Singapore**, this project connects a historical route map with an interactive Gephi network. Visitors can follow the documented journeys, inspect the evidence behind individual relationships, and explore related collecting institutions.

## Read the story

The exhibition follows three chapters: **the material journeys → the circulation of knowledge → collections today**. A visual cover introduces the question, a single compact chapter navigation links directly to each workspace, and larger reading text gives the historical argument space before the interactive tools.

The exhibition asks where manuscripts were sent, who examined and organised them, and how the collections survive today. Maps and the complete Gephi network are directly visible within that reading sequence.

Follow a route, read the Beijing–Lanzhou telegram, then examine the network through Pelliot’s memorandum and the London cataloguing team. Each example gives names, recorded roles, source pages and uncertainty. Contextual actions locate the event being discussed; a further-reading section leads to the corresponding source passages. See [reading and research use](docs/NARRATIVE_READING.md).

The default map is the interactive route view. The original QGIS regional export and PDF remain available as a reference. The full graph combines the preserved Gephi export (122 nodes, 136 relationships) with cited additions, for 132 nodes and 157 relationships. Search and advanced filters remain secondary tools.

This narrative layout takes inspiration from the cover, chapter navigation and text–visual pacing of [Storying on the Coquille River](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/3678bc6932c74332b0d57adf3434aa55). It uses the project’s existing local assets and research records.

## Explore

- **Historical journeys:** the QGIS regional map and original PDF, with an animated route view and supplementary playback tools.
- **Readable knowledge records:** three examples with names, roles, dates, evidence locations and uncertainties displayed directly.
- **Gephi result with cited additions:** 132 nodes, 157 directed relationships and 48 activity records; bilingual search, neighbourhood focus, edge inspection and year filtering.
- **Relationship guide:** full names, explicit roles and event-centred diagrams, with original source/target directions and edge-specific evidence. See [display rules and provenance](docs/RELATIONSHIP_GUIDE.md).
- **Cave photographs:** three locally hosted, credited images between the narrative chapters, with bilingual captions and a keyboard-accessible viewer.
- **Collections today:** five related institutions across London, Paris and Beijing, with official collection links. The preservation section compares three dated treatment examples, with two further studies of fragmentation and rebinding; see [sources and boundaries](docs/PRESERVATION.md).
- **English / 中文:** switches the interface, narrative, network labels and research summaries while preserving selections.
- **Evidence access:** 21 network source entries and 57 evidence records, including English summaries and the limits of the supporting material.
- **Presentation and accessibility:** presentation mode, keyboard controls, searchable node and relationship lists, and responsive layouts.

## Research scope

The historical case study focuses on **1900–1910**. Current collecting institutions are shown separately from historical custody. The route map uses schematic geographical connections; the network uses the author's exported Gephi layout.

Cases, scrolls, objects, photographs and printed versions are distinct units. A proposed action or recorded promise is not presented as completed movement or cataloguing. Shared attendance at an event does not establish correspondence between every pair of attendees. See [Data and interpretation](DATA_NOTES.md) and the in-page source details.

The relationship guide rearranges original links around a selected event. In the full graph, compact view translates five disconnected components closer together for readability, retaining positions within each component. Visitors can restore the original Gephi layout. The downloadable GEXF retains the original exported positions, sizes and colours.

## Access check

Before the story-edition redesign, on 29 October 2026, the project owner reported a successful family test in China: the webpage, route map and relationship network all loaded. This is a user-reported test; the location, network operator and browser were not recorded. See [access-check provenance](docs/access-checks.json).

## Run locally

No package installation, API key or build is required.

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000 --directory dist
```

Open `http://localhost:8000/`. Opening `dist/index.html` directly also works.

## Deploy with GitHub Pages

1. In the repository, open **Settings → Pages**.
2. Set **Source** to **GitHub Actions**.
3. Run the **Deploy Dunhuang exhibition to GitHub Pages** workflow, or push a change to `main`.

The workflow checks the static files and research-data counts, then publishes only `dist/`. Source code, documentation and original acknowledgements remain in the repository. The site uses relative asset paths, so it works under a GitHub project subpath.

If you fork this repository, update the canonical URL and live-demo link:

```bash
python3 tools/configure_pages.py YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME YOUR_REPOSITORY
```

Deployment follows [GitHub's official Pages workflow documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/using-custom-workflows-with-github-pages).

This public repository contains the exhibition snapshot and its code. The research PDFs and private workspace configuration are not part of the website repository. Data updates are deliberate rather than automatic: changing a research spreadsheet does not silently change the published exhibition.

网页围绕“文献被运往何处、谁参与检查与整理、今天如何保存”展开。流转地图和完整Gephi网络在正文直接可见，电报、检查备忘录与编目团队的记录为图形提供具体解释。各例附来源与页码，可在图中定位，再继续查阅原文或馆藏目录。QGIS原始区域详图、PDF和Gephi原文件保留查阅与下载；软件名称与文件入口放在方法说明和图注中。

Website release **v2.8.0 · 30 October 2026**.

The layout retains the viewport sizing and normal-flow records introduced in 2.4. Playback controls now sit inside the optional map tools below the visual. See [layout rules](docs/READING_LAYOUT.md) and [the current reading sequence](docs/NARRATIVE_READING.md).


Edition 2.8.0 adds source-located scholarly contacts from 1909–1910. The original Gephi file is unchanged; new nodes have provisional positions and have not been assigned new centrality values. Six added activity records can overlap earlier viewing accounts. See [the additions, evidence limits and Gephi import guide](docs/relationship-additions.md).
